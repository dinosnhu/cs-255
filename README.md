**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The client was DriverPass, which is a company that wants to offer driving lessons and such to students. They want to expand digitally and have an online website that students can access to make appointments, payments, view course material, etc., along with other core website features. The system also had to have support for users with various rights and roles, such as students, employees, administrators, tech support, etc.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I think I did the main projects pretty well. I'm happy with how my UML diagrams turned out and how I was pretty comfy using LucidCharts. I also think my business requirements document is pretty thorough and detailed, and I included as much information as I could that I thought would be essential to.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I'd probably focus more on the UML diagrams. I would've included more detail in them, fixed some of the jagged lines, and made it more visually appealing. There's also other stuff I could've done better like using more specific UML symbols for my UML class diagram, but I didn't know all of them.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I read the entire interview transcript with DriverPass. This helped me get a full idea of what the company wanted and expected, and it helped me turn it all into system design and business requirement documents. It's very important to consider the user's needs because you're designing the product for them. They are paying you and using your product. No one else is. So if there needs aren't considered, then the project can fail and lose revenue.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I read the requirements of the software first, and if those aren't established, I will get them myself and make a thorough list of all of the requirements. Once we have those and we understand every expectation, we can work on creating a plan and schedule for every part of the project. The most critical components such as the project's foundations should be coded first. We can worry about polishing and refinement later on, once we already have a solid base to build off of. These are also the strategies or techniques I would use.
